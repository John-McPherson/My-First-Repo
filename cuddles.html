            <h2>Cuddles: A Last Chance Crime Story</h2>
            <p>
                Cuddles’ life ain’t too difficult. He’s got a cushy job collecting protection money for a local crime
                boss. But after he’s partnered up with the boss’ son things start to go sideways. First, he finds out
                that his partner has been skimming off the top and then, even worse, the FBI are hot on their trail.
                Cuddles quickly finds that he has to play all sides against each other in order to survive.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cuddles is a story of divided loyalty and self-preservation. It’s about trying to do the right thing
                when you’ve spent your entire life doing the opposite. It’s about survival and what that can end up
                costing you.
