            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Jed McPherson is a comic writer. He’s mostly known for Deadbeat: a neo noir thriller about a deatbeat dad
                trying to reconnect with his daughter through armed robbery. He also wrote Jacob - a serial killer comic
                which he assures us is 100% not autobiographical.

            <br>
            <p>
                But he doesn’t just write crime comics he’s also worked on The Show – a deranged reality-tv satire kind of
                like the Truman Show as envisaged by Hunter S. Thompson.
